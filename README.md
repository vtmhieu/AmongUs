# *AmongUs*: A Sandbox for Measuring and Detecting Agentic Deception

[Paper link.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04072)

This project introduces the game "Among Us" as a model organism for lying and deception and studies how AI agents learn to express lying and deception, while evaluating the effectiveness of AI safety techniques to detect and control out-of-distribution deception.

## Overview

The aim is to simulate the popular multiplayer game "Among Us" using AI agents and analyze their behavior, particularly their ability to deceive and lie, which is central to the game's mechanics.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/7vik/AmongUs.git
   cd AmongUs
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n amongus python=3.10
   conda activate amongus
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install numpy pandas networkx streamlit dotenv requests aiohttp
   ```

## Run Games

To run the sandbox and log games of various LLMs playing against each other, run:

```
python main.py
```

By default, agents run against local models via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (see below). To use cloud models instead, add a `.env` file with an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API key, and set model names without the `ollama/` prefix (e.g. `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`) in `agent_config.py` or via the `--crewmate_llm`/`--impostor_llm` flags.

Alternatively, you can download 400 full-game logs (for `Phi-4-15b` and `Llama-3.3-70b-instruct`) and 810 game summaries from the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/7vik/AmongUs) dataset to reproduce the results in the paper (and evaluate your own techniques!).

### Running with Ollama (local models)

You can run every agent in the game against a model served locally by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), with no API key and no cost.

1. **Install Ollama** — download it from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download), or on macOS with Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install ollama
   ```

2. **Start the Ollama server** (skip this if you installed the desktop app, which runs it for you):
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

3. **Pull a model** — any model in the [Ollama library](https://ollama.com/library) works. For example:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ```

4. **Point the agents at your model.** Model choices live in [`among-agents/amongagents/envs/configs/agent_config.py`](among-agents/amongagents/envs/configs/agent_config.py); any model name prefixed with `ollama/` is routed to your local Ollama server instead of OpenRouter:
   ```python
   OLLAMA_MODEL = "ollama/llama3.2:latest"
   ```
   Change `OLLAMA_MODEL` to any model you've pulled (e.g. `"ollama/gemma3:12b-it-qat"`) to switch every agent at once.

   You can also override the model per-run without editing the file:
   ```bash
   python main.py --crewmate_llm ollama/llama3.2:latest --impostor_llm ollama/llama3.2:latest
   ```

5. **Run the game** as usual:
   ```bash
   python main.py --num_games 1
   ```

No `.env`/API key is required for Ollama models — the `ollama/` prefix is stripped and the request goes to `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions`, Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Deception ELO

After running (or downloading) the games, to reproduce our Deception ELO results, run the following notebook:

```
reports/2025_02_26_deception_ELO_v3_ci.ipynb
```

The other report files can be used to reproduce the respective results.

## Caching Activations

Once the (full) game logs are in place, use the following command to cache the activations of the LLMs:

```
python linear-probes/cache_activations.py --dataset <dataset_name>
```

This loads up the HuggingFace models and caches the activations of the specified layers for each game action step. This step is computationally expensive, so it is recommended to run this using GPUs.

Use `configs.py` to specify the model and layer to cache, and other configuration options.

## LLM-based Evaluation (for Lying, Awareness, Deception, and Planning)

To evaluate the game actions by passing agent outputs to an LLM, run:

```
bash evaluations/run_evals.sh
```
You will need to add a `.env` file with an OpenAI API key.

Alternatively, you can download the ground truth labels from the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/7vik/AmongUs).

(TODO)

## Training Linear Probes

Once the activations are cached, training linear probes is easy. Just run:

```
python linear-probes/train_all_probes.py
```
You can choose which datasets to train probes on - by default, it will train on all datasets.

## Evaluating Linear Probes

To evaluate the linear probes, run:

```
python linear-probes/eval_all_probes.py
```
You can choose which datasets to evaluate probes on - by default, it will evaluate on all datasets.

It will store the results in `linear-probes/results/`, which are used to generate the plots in the paper.

## Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)

We use the [Goodfire API](https://goodfire.ai/) to evaluate SAE features on the game logs. To do this, run the notebook:

```
reports/2025_02_27_sparse_autoencoders.ipynb
```
You will need to add a `.env` file with a Goodfire API key.
